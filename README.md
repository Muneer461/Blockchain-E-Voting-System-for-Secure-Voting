# block-chain-e-voting-system
Project Title: Blockchain Evoting System Project Overview: This project aims to develop a decentralized, tamper-proof voting system using blockchain technology. The system will enable users to vote remotely without the need for a trusted intermediary such as a polling station or election official. Users will be able to cast their votes securely by creating a digital signature using their private key, which is stored locally on their device. Once the votes have been recorded on the blockchain, they cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring transparency and accuracy in the electoral process.
